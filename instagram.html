                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about software development and Colorado sports.
                    I use Instagram to build relationships with my clients, from previous work
                    as a Realtor, I would center myself around friends and neighbors within the community.
                    Another great addition is sharing my personal life because even though work is accomplishing your
                    goals are important. Spending time with family and friends is so much more sweeter!.  
                    Connect with me to stay updated on my projects and interests!</p>

        <h4>Realtor</h4>
        <p>During my years as a Realtor and Marketer, I was very easy to talk to and get along with. There's an old 
            saying "It's not so much what you know, but who you know", as cliche as it seems its very true in todays world.
            I have sold good chunk of Real Estate and building a relationship with your clients is the most important part. 
            Without your clients, you don't get paid. 
        </p>

        <p2>
            Diving into my instagram I have gotten to travel around towards the west into Utah, traveling was a huge deal because
            my business paid for it. I've worked along side a BBQ resturant and met some really interesting people. 
            I know this doesn't seem like it has any relevance to my resume, but in reality it actually does. First, being Companys
            could careless if you're a great coder or programmer. Its about being unique, punctual, people person. You can be a great
            programmer, but if you don't know how to collaborate with your colleagues, you're not going anywhere in life.
