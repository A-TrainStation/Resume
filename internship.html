                <p>This project involved developing an online parking management system for Indian Hills Community College. 
                    It included features such as user registration, parking space booking, and payment processing. 
                    My role in this project was to implement the front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                    as well as integrate it with the back-end system developed by the team.</p>

                    I worked closely with the web development team to understand requirements and
